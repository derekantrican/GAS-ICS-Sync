        **Thank you for wanting to request a feature in OctoPrint!**


        Before you go ahead with your request, please note that any feature that is only
        of interest to a small sub group will not be implemented. Only such features
        that are of interest to a majority of users will be implemented as part of the script.
        
        If you have a very specific request for your use case and would like help implementing
        it, feel free to create a [discussion](https://github.com/derekantrican/GAS-ICS-Sync/discussions) instead and we can help you there.
