# GAS-ICS-Sync

### ⚠️⚠️ This project is looking for contributors and people to help answer questions! Please message @developers on the Discord! ⚠️⚠️

This is a standalone script (that consists of multiple files). The purpose is to sync ics/ical calendars to Google Calendar. Google Calendar *can* already do this, but updates only happen once every 12 or even 24 hrs. This script can be run much more frequently.

[If you want to use this, please copy the script from here](https://script.google.com/home/projects/1B5pYZ1n7zwY7mW7qWiIr0KXA8Q86P5WbjzABjz_wr38pOVmwC_ld3Srj/edit)

**To make a copy in the new Google Apps Script interface:**
1. Go to the project overview icon on the left (looks like this: ⓘ)
2. Click the "copy" icon on the top right (looks like two files on top of each other)

**NOTE:** If too many people are accessing the file at the same time, Google may lock you out. You can follow these instructions to set up the script: https://github.com/derekantrican/GAS-ICS-Sync/wiki/Setting-up-the-script-manually

**To update code in existing Google Apps Script project:**
1. Make sure you have this GitHub repo open in a separate window/tab
2. Go to your Google Apps Script project
3. Copy and save content of each file with `.gs` extenstion from this repo to a respective file in your GAS project
   - :warning: The `Code.gs` file has to be handled in a special way: **ensure to preserve `SETTINGS` section** ([lines 20-53](Code.gs#L20-L53)) so that you don't lose your own settings
