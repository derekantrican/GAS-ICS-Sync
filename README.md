# GAS-ICS-Sync

This is a standalone script (that consists of multiple files). The purpose is to sync ics/ical calendars to Google Calendar. Google Calendar *can* already do this, but updates only happen once every 12 or even 24 hrs. This script can be run much more frequently.

[If you want to use this, please copy the script from here](https://script.google.com/d/1BOk8MDLbLaHh6SwG1M1tsgNXjkcC-79LE0QoipRuTDxbO3fMVvqoROQD/edit?newcopy=true)

**To make a copy in the new Google Apps Script interface:**
1. Go to the project overview icon on the left (looks like this: â“˜)
2. Click the "copy" icon on the top right (looks like two files on top of each other)

**NOTE:** If too many people are accessing the file at the same time, Google may lock you out. You can follow these instructions to set up the script: https://github.com/derekantrican/GAS-ICS-Sync/wiki/Setting-up-the-script-manually
